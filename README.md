# Whiskers Device Selector
The Whiskers Device Selector is a single-file, interactive HTML application designed to guide users through selecting the correct IIoT hardware based on their specific monitoring needs and environmental constraints.

# Disclaimer
Note: The code, structure, and logic for this interactive wizard were generated with the assistance of Google's Gemini AI. It was built by feeding the AI a product specification document to quickly prototype the selection process.

# How to Use
1. Since the app is built using Vanilla JavaScript and relies on CDNs for its styling (Tailwind CSS and Font Awesome), it is completely self-contained.
2. Download the whiskers_selector.html file.
3. Double-click the file to open it in any modern web browser.
4. No build tools, Node.js, or local servers are required to run it.
